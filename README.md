# Kraken Trading Assistant

NOTE: To use this software you will need your own Kraken API Keys installed in the file assets/main.keys.
api_key = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
api_secret = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"

You will also need a FREE subsccription to PySimpleGUI. No files are installed in your machine. This is the safest Python GUI method that I am aware of: https://www.pysimplegui.com/

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, its implementation, and technical details. 
You may want to add: Versatility for connecting to other exchanges and/or data sources. 

These tools are designed to assist TOKEN Traders who have accounts on Kraken Crypto Exchange make trading decisions and monitor account balances. DYOR
